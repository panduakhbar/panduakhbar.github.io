## my lily

I hope today, you stopped to feel the wind on your skin. I hope today you paused for even a moment—to feel sunlight, to take a breath between chapters of your busy life. I love you.

I hope you know that even in chaos, the world holds moments meant only for you. I love you.

We live in places so far apart the seasons forget to sync, and yet I feel you with me. I still find traces of you in the smallest things; soft winds, the scent of rain, the hush of petals unfolding. I love you.

If I could, I’d send you a single lily, still closed, a whisper of what’s to come.
You’d place it in water and watch it bloom slowly. That some things—like peace, like healing, like love, bloom when they are ready.

Take care of your heart,
Eat something warm,
dream softly tonight,
And until I write to you again—
May your days be filled with lilies in full bloom,
May you find a moment of quiet joy,
and I will wait for you always. I love you.
