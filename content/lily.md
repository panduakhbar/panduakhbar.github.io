I hope today you stopped to feel the wind on your skin. I hope you paused, even for a moment—to feel the sunlight, to take a breath between chapters of the rush of your days. I hope you know that even in the midst of chaos, the world holds moments meant only for you. _I love you._ Though we live in places so far apart that even the seasons seem out of sync, I still feel you close to me. I find traces of you in the gentlest things—the soft caress of the wind, the scent of rain, the quiet unfolding of petals.. _I love you._

If I could, I’d send you a single lily—still closed, a whisper of what’s to come.  
You’d place it in water and watch it bloom slowly. A reminder that some things—like peace, like healing, like love—bloom when they are ready.

Take care of your heart,  
Eat something warm,  
Dream softly tonight.  
And until I write to you again—  
May your days be filled with lilies in full bloom,  
May you find a moment of quiet joy,  
And know, my love,
my heart remains yours, now and forever.

_I love you._
