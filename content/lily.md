I hope today you stopped to feel the wind on your skin. I hope you paused, even for a moment—to feel the sunlight, to take a breath between chapters of your busy life. _I love you._ I hope you know that even in the midst of chaos, the world holds moments meant only for you. _I love you._ We live in places so far apart the seasons forget to sync, and yet I feel you with me. I still find traces of you in the smallest things: soft winds, the scent of rain, the hush of petals unfolding. _I love you._

If I could, I’d send you a single lily—still closed, a whisper of what’s to come.  
You’d place it in water and watch it bloom slowly. A reminder that some things—like peace, like healing, like love—bloom when they are ready.

Take care of your heart,  
Eat something warm,  
Dream softly tonight.  
And until I write to you again—  
May your days be filled with lilies in full bloom,  
May you find a moment of quiet joy,  
And I will wait for you always. _I love you._
